# UART Communication on Xilinx FPGA

## Overview

This project implements UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) communication on Xilinx FPGA using VHDL. UART is a widely used serial communication protocol that enables data exchange between devices. The project includes VHDL modules for both the transmitter and receiver, providing a flexible and scalable solution for FPGA-based communication.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Separate VHDL modules for the transmitter and receiver, enhancing code clarity and ease of maintenance.

- **Configurability:** Adjustable parameters such as baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits to accommodate diverse communication requirements.

- **Reliable Communication:** Incorporates error-checking mechanisms and synchronization techniques for robust and error-free data transmission.

- **Scalability:** Designed to be compatible with various Xilinx FPGA architectures, facilitating integration into a range of projects.

- **Simulation Support:** Comprehensive testbench for simulation and verification, ensuring accurate functionality before deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xilinx FPGA development environment (e.g., Vivado)
- VHDL synthesis and simulation tools

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/niladrigithub/uart-communication-fpga.git
    ```

2. Open the project in your Xilinx FPGA development environment.

3. Configure UART parameters in the VHDL files based on your communication requirements.

4. Synthesize and implement the design on your Xilinx FPGA.

## Usage

1. Integrate the UART transmitter and receiver modules into your FPGA-based project.

2. Adjust UART parameters according to your specific communication needs.

3. Connect UART pins appropriately to external devices.

4. Verify functionality using simulation tools and test the implementation in your hardware setup.
